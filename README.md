- 👋 Hi, I’m @ciera1986 AKA Ciera. It's nice to meet you all. It's been a while since I was on here and I'm glad to be back!
- 👀 I’m interested in early learning coding because I teach grades k-5 using block coding!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all about Github and all that it can do, as well as instructional design! I want to train others on how to use Github and it's many benefits.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects dealing with education of young children.
- 📫 You can reach me by email or my portfolio. cieracarr86@gmail.com   http://www.cieracarr.com
